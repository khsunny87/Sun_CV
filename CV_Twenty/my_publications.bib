He had a history of traumatic hemothorax and pleural drainage for empyema in the right chest and was considered unable to tolerate thoracic surgery because of sepsis and progressive aspiration pneumonia. In order to aggressively drain the mediastinal contamination, we performed internal drainage by placing a Levin tube into the mediastinum through the perforation site. This procedure, in conjunction with controlling sepsis and providing sufficient postpyloric nutrition, allowed the esophageal injury to completely heal.},

   abstract = {The identification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is clinically important for diagnosing cancer. We have previously developed a size-based filtration platform followed by epithelial cell adhesion molecule immunofluorescence staining for detecting CTCs. To characterize CTCs independently of cell surface protein expression, we incorporated a chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to detect abnormal copy numbers of chromosomes in cells collected from peripheral blood samples by the size-based filtration platform. Aneuploid cells were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer. Unexpectedly, aneuploid cells were also detected in the control group, which consisted of peripheral blood samples from patients with benign lung diseases, such as empyema necessitatis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. These findings suggest that chromosomal abnormalities are observed not only in tumor cells, but also in benign infectious diseases. Thus, our findings present new considerations and bring into light the possibility of false positives when using FISH for cancer diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become an important treatment modality in pediatric patients with cardiopulmonary failure, but few studies have been conducted in Korea. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients younger than 18 years who were placed on ECMO between January 2004 and December 2014 at Samsung Medical Center. RESULTS: We identified 116 children on ECMO support. The overall rate of successful weaning was 51.7%, and the survival to discharge rate was 37.1%. There were 39, 61, and 16 patients on ECMO for respiratory, cardiac, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respectively. The weaning rate in each group was 48.7%, 55.7%, and 43.8%, respectively. The survival rate was 43.6%, 36.1%, and 25.0%, respectively. Sixteen patients on ECMO had functional single ventricle physiology; in this group, the weaning rate was 43.8% and the survival rate was 31.3%. Ten patients were on ECMO as a bridge to transplantation (8 for heart and 2 for lung). In patients with heart transplantation, the rate of survival to transplantation was 50.0%, and the overall rate of survival to discharge was 37.5%. CONCLUSION: An increasing trend in pediatric ECMO utilization was observed. The outcomes were favorable considering the early experiences that were included in this study and the limited supply of specialized equipment for pediatric patients.},

   abstract = {Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has been performed with increasing frequency worldwide to improve the low survival rate of conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR). Several studies have shown that among patients who experience in-hospital cardiac arrest, better survival outcomes and neurological outcomes can be expected after ECPR than after CCPR. However, studies have not clearly shown a short-term survival benefit of ECPR for patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Favorable outcomes are associated with a shorter low-flow time, an initial shockable rhythm, lower serum lactate levels, higher blood pH, and a lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Indications for ECPR include young age, witnessed arrest with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, an initial shockable rhythm, correctable causes such as a cardiac etiology, and no return of spontaneous circulation within 10-20 minutes of CCPR. ECPR is a complex intervention that requires a highly trained team, specialized equipment, and multidisciplinary support within a healthcare system, and it has the risk of several life-threatening complications. Therefore, physicians should carefully select patients for ECPR who can gain the most benefit, instead of applying ECPR indiscriminately.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of the grade and jet direction of residual aortic regurgitation (rAR) after valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR). METHODS: The study enrolled 248 adult patients who underwent VSRR between 1995 and 2021. The patients were divided into groups based on the postoperative rAR. Patients with rAR were further categorized according to rAR grade and jet direction. The primary endpoint was the development of aortic regurgitation of moderate or greater (>/=moderate) severity and/or the need for valve replacement during the follow-up, analyzed by a multivariable competing risk analysis. The secondary endpoints included the occurrence of rAR and overall survival. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 36.5 years, and 79.8% had been diagnosed with connective tissue disease. After VSRR, 146 patients did not present with rAR; however, 102 had rAR (77 with minimal central, 18 with minimal eccentric, and 7 with mild rAR). The 5-year and 8-year incidence rates of the primary endpoint were 14.6% and 17.9%, respectively. rAR was a significant risk factor (P = .001), and eccentricity and mild rAR seemed to have important roles. The risk factors for rAR included dilated root, preoperative moderate regurgitation, and redo sternotomy. Overall survival was influenced only by age. CONCLUSIONS: rAR after VSRR operation could be a risk factor for AR progression. Minimal central rAR generally has a tolerable clinical course; however, patients with even minimal eccentric AR may develop AR progression, so active surveillance and timely management might be required. Furthermore, early VSRR can help reduce the rAR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the influence of early diagnosis (ED) on surgical outcomes in patients definitively diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 38 patients with LDS who underwent aortic surgery at our institution between January 1995 and June 2022. The primary endpoint was freedom from aortic reoperation. RESULTS: Among the patients, the median age at the initial surgery was 33 (range: 39-44) years, and 23 (60.5%) patients were male. Twenty-one (55.3%; aortic dissection or rupture (n = 2) and aneurysm (n = 19)) patients were diagnosed with LDS before the initial surgery (ED group). Meanwhile, the remaining 17 (44.7%; aortic dissection or rupture (n = 13) and aneurysm (n = 4)) patients were after surgery [delayed diagnosis (DD) group]. The ED group had significantly lower rates of emergency surgery and concomitant arch procedure (P < .001, respectively) but a higher rate of valve-sparing root surgery (P = .018) compared to the DD group. No in-hospital mortality was observed in either group. Nevertheless, the ED group had a shorter postoperative hospital stay (median difference: 3 days, P = .032) and a lower rate of aortic reoperation (P = .013). CONCLUSION: Early detection of LDS may help in preventing acute aortic syndrome, reducing the risk of aortic reoperation, and potentially shortening hospital stay. Careful medical management before surgery could contribute to better clinical outcomes and an improved quality of life for patients with LDS.},
